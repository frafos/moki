# nginx docker

The nginx docker is used to expose both the backend api and the frontend client
under the same dns.

The `dev` stage redirect all request where uri start by `/api` to the api docker.
Other request are handled by the front one.

The `prod` stage force the redirection from http to http(s). 
**TODO** Certs are handled by LE (**must be optional, some server are runned behind fw**).

### docker multi stage 

[Have a look at the official doc](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)

### docker container name as hostnam

Once again, [have a look at the official doc](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/) - 
"Each container for a service (...) a hostname identical to the container name."
